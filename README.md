Java UI CucumberJVM Framework by Simonkay
==================================
This Framework is provided by me to help you hit the ground running with java, selenium and cucumberJVM BDD based acceptance / end2end GUI tests.  The framework itself has many powerful features which are all outlined below.  I will continue working on this throughout 2018 and I also encourage you to fork it too!

Some powerful features of this framework are:
- Parallel execution using teymers for cucumber JVM
- Browserstack integration [upcoming]
- Aliased random data with step persistence
- GUI based tests written in plain English
- Page Object Design Pattern
- Page Factory Design Pattern with LoadableComponent
- Configurable Drivers & Environments
- Selenium GRID support for local distribution / docker zalenium d
- Headless testing capabilities (chrome)
- Good use of Spring for dependency injection
- Reporting with a beautiful UI which really compliments BDD, I have done the hardwork for you with populating the data
- Logging capabilities per forked process using Log4j

The Stack!
------------
- [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) A static, simple programming language
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) Dependency manager, Build manager/executor, Amazing tool! :)
